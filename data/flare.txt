NAME
    Flare - a structure-based design application

SYNOPSIS
     Flare
     Flare [options] Flare_project.flr
     Flare [options] [import options] molecule_file [[import options] molecule_file_2...]

DESCRIPTION
    Flare is a structure-based design tool for drug discovery. It provides a
    suite of methods for understanding protein-ligand interactions,
    including protein electrostatic potentials, docking, 3D RISM and
    WaterSwap.

  Input
    The input molecules can be read in PDB, SDF, mol2, or XED format. The
    input format should be autodetected. Import options specified will apply
    to all subsequent molecules until more options are specified. These new
    options will then apply to the next set of molecules. This way, it is
    possible for each molecule to have its own input options. Instead of
    loading individual input molecules, a Flare project file can instead be
    provided.

OPTIONS
  IMPORT OPTIONS
    -c, --charge yes|no|ask|prep
         Determines whether to re-assign the protonation state of molecules.
         If 'y'es, molecules are charged for pH7. 'n'o leaves molecules
         unchanged, using the input protonation state. 'p'rep opens a
         protein prep dialog once the application has started. 'a'sk is the
         default value. The first letter of each argument can be used as a
         shortcut.

    -m, --read-mode auto|protein|ligand
         Read the input molecules as 'p'roteins or 'l'igands. The default
         behaviour is to 'a'utomatically detect the molecule type. Ligands
         that are read as proteins will be inserted into the protein view.
         The first letter of each argument can be used as a shortcut.

    -r, --role rolename,description
         Specify a custom role to import molecules in to. Subsequent
         molecules will all be added to this role. The description is
         optional. This option only takes effect when the read mode is
         'ligand' or it is 'auto' and the type is detected as ligand.

  GENERAL OPTIONS
    --disable-python
         Disables the Python integration.

    --export-preferences file.ini
         Exports the preferences to the file.

    --import-preferences file.ini
         Imports the preferences from the file.

    -h, --help
         Print short help text.

    -H, --extendedhelp
         Print extended help text.

    -V, --version
         Print version information and license availability.

EXAMPLES
      Flare my_project.flr

    Opens the project in 'my_project.flr'

      Flare -c y -m auto -r "Myrole,My custom role" mols.sdf

    Imports the contents of 'mols.sdf' in to a new 'Myrole' role, recharging
    all molecules and autodetecting whether entries are ligand or proteins.

ENVIRONMENT
    CRESSET_BROKER
        Set the location of the Cresset Engine Broker in the format
        hostname:port. This can be overridden in the preferences.
